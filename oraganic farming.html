    <dt>Organic farming</dt><br><br>
    <dd>System of crop cultivation that uses biological methods of fertilization and pest control as substitutes for chemical fertilizers and pesticides, <br>which are regarded by supporters of organic methods as harmful to health and the environment and unnecessary for successful cultivation.<br> It was initiated as a conscious rejection of modern agri-chemical techniques in the 1930s by the British agronomist Sir Albert Howard.<br> Miscellaneous organic materials, including animal manure, compost, grass turf, straw, and other crop residues, are applied to fields to improve both soil structure and moisture-holding capacity and to nourish soil life, which in turn nourishes plants. <br>(Chemical fertilizers, by contrast, feed plants directly.) Biological pest control is achieved through preventive methods, including diversified farming, crop rotation, the planting of pest-deterrent species, and the use of integrated pest management techniques. Bioengineered strains are avoided. Since organic farming is time-consuming, organically grown produce tends to be expensive. Organic produce formerly accounted for a minuscule portion of total American farm output, but it has seen a huge proportional increase in sales in recent years.</dd><br><br>
