    <dd>Although the terms “genetically modified” and “genetically engineered” are used interchangeably in public discourse, they have different connotations that are relevant to the debate on the use of GMOs in agriculture. In Canada, GM foods are regulated as “novel foods” under section B.28.001 of the Food and Drug Regulations pursuant to the Food and Drugs Act.5 The regulations define “genetically modify” as “chang[ing] the heritable traits of a plant, animal or microorganism by means of intentional manipulation.”6 This definition is broader than the one above, as it includes old and new approaches to manipulating the genetic makeup of living organisms and does not list specific technologies.

        Genetic engineering is a type of modern biotechnology used to modify the genome or genetic material – of living organisms. This method introduces specific novel traits into a plant or animal by direct manipulation of its genome. Genetic engineering has typically relied on the use of recombinant DNA, which is produced by joining multiple DNA fragments, usually for genetic manipulation.7 Recombinant DNA technology can be used to introduce foreign DNA – either from the same species or from a different one – into the genome of a living organism. This technology thus enables the introduction of individual genes into an already established commercial crop variety.8</dd><br> <br>
