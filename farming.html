    <h1>Ago Techniques</h1>
    <p>Organic farming is agriculture that makes healthy food, healthy soils, healthy plants, and healthy environments a priority, along with crop productivity. Organic farmers use biological fertilizer inputs and management practices such as cover cropping and crop rotation to improve soil quality and build organic soil matter. By increasing the amount of organic matter in the soil, organic farmers enhance the soil’s ability to absorb water, reducing the impacts of drought and flooding. Improving soil organic matter also helps it to absorb and store carbon and other nutrients need to grow healthy crops, which, in turn, are better able to resist insects and diseases.<br><br>

        Organic production systems do not use genetically modified (GM) seed, synthetic pesticides or fertilizers. Some of the essential characteristics of organic systems include design and implementation of an organic system plan that describes the practices used in producing crops and livestock products; a detailed recordkeeping system that tracks all products from the field to point of sale; and maintenance of buffer zones to prevent inadvertent contamination by synthetic farm chemicals from adjacent conventional fields.<br>
        How do you think you get the <a href="">crops</a> that you eat? Who gives you the vegetables? Yes, of course, <a href=""> the market</a> does. But, from where does he get them? We will look at this entire concept of agriculture and <a href=""> agricultural techniques</a> in this chapter. It will help you in understanding how the <a href="">food</a> network in our country performs. However, we will start from the basic question of what agriculture is. Let’s find out more about Agricultural Techniques</p>

                <dd>System of crop cultivation that uses biological methods of fertilization and pest control as substitutes for chemical fertilizers and pesticides, <br>which are regarded by supporters of organic methods as harmful to health and the environment and unnecessary for successful cultivation.<br> It was initiated as a conscious rejection of modern agri-chemical techniques in the 1930s by the British agronomist Sir Albert Howard.<br> Miscellaneous organic materials, including animal manure, compost, grass turf, straw, and other crop residues, are applied to fields to improve both soil structure and moisture-holding capacity and to nourish soil life, which in turn nourishes plants. <br>(Chemical fertilizers, by contrast, feed plants directly.) Biological pest control is achieved through preventive methods, including diversified farming, crop rotation, the planting of pest-deterrent species, and the use of integrated pest management techniques. Bioengineered strains are avoided. Since organic farming is time-consuming, organically grown produce tends to be expensive. Organic produce formerly accounted for a minuscule portion of total American farm output, but it has seen a huge proportional increase in sales in recent years.</dd><br><br>

                <dd>Conventional farming, also known as traditional farming or industrial agriculture, refers to farming systems which include the use of synthetic chemical fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides and other continual inputs, genetically modified organisms, concentrated animal feeding operation]s, heavy irrigation, intensive tillage, or concentrated monoculture production.<br> Thus conventional agriculture is typically highly resource-demanding and energy-intensive, but also highly productive. <br>Despite its name, conventional agricultural methods have only been in development since the late Nineteenth Century, and did not become widespread until after World War 2 (see Wikipedia:Green Revolution).
                    Conventional farming is usually contrasted to organic farming (or sometimes sustainable agriculture or permaculture), as these respond to site-specific conditions by integrating cultural, biological, and mechanical practices that foster cycling of resources, promote ecological balance, and conserve biodiversity.<br>Rather than using synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, growth regulators and livestock feed additives, organic farming systems rely on crop rotation, animal and plant manures as fertilizers, some hand weeding and biological pest control.[2] Some conventional agriculture operations may include limited polyculture, or some form of Integrated Pest Management. (see Industrial organic agriculture). </dd> <br> <br>

                <dd>Although the terms “genetically modified” and “genetically engineered” are used interchangeably in public discourse, they have different connotations that are relevant to the debate on the use of GMOs in agriculture. In Canada, GM foods are regulated as “novel foods” under section B.28.001 of the Food and Drug Regulations pursuant to the Food and Drugs Act.5 The regulations define “genetically modify” as “chang[ing] the heritable traits of a plant, animal or microorganism by means of intentional manipulation.”6 This definition is broader than the one above, as it includes old and new approaches to manipulating the genetic makeup of living organisms and does not list specific technologies.

                    Genetic engineering is a type of modern biotechnology used to modify the genome or genetic material – of living organisms. This method introduces specific novel traits into a plant or animal by direct manipulation of its genome. Genetic engineering has typically relied on the use of recombinant DNA, which is produced by joining multiple DNA fragments, usually for genetic manipulation.7 Recombinant DNA technology can be used to introduce foreign DNA – either from the same species or from a different one – into the genome of a living organism. This technology thus enables the introduction of individual genes into an already established commercial crop variety.8</dd><br> <br>

                <dd>Using crop diversification and companion planting (allowing for increased pest control, building healthy soil, shade benefits, reducing available space for weeds, and more).
                    Rotating crops (building healthy soil, reducing buildup of certain pest/disease populations, and replenishing soil nutrients).
                    Planting cover crops (protecting soil and reducing erosion, and increasing organic matter and nutrient content of soil).
                    Focusing on plant varieties that are suitable for our specific climate (using drought or low-water-tolerant plants adapted to local soil and climatic conditions to avoid fighting nature or putting more resources into growing healthy plants than necessary).
                    Using native plant species where possible (especially pollinator-friendly plants like wildflowers to increase the presence of bees, birds, etc.).</dd><br><br>
