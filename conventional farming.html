    <dt>conventional farming</dt><br><br>
    <dd>Conventional farming, also known as traditional farming or industrial agriculture, refers to farming systems which include the use of synthetic chemical fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides and other continual inputs, genetically modified organisms, concentrated animal feeding operation]s, heavy irrigation, intensive tillage, or concentrated monoculture production.<br> Thus conventional agriculture is typically highly resource-demanding and energy-intensive, but also highly productive. <br>Despite its name, conventional agricultural methods have only been in development since the late Nineteenth Century, and did not become widespread until after World War 2 (see Wikipedia:Green Revolution).
        Conventional farming is usually contrasted to organic farming (or sometimes sustainable agriculture or permaculture), as these respond to site-specific conditions by integrating cultural, biological, and mechanical practices that foster cycling of resources, promote ecological balance, and conserve biodiversity.<br>Rather than using synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, growth regulators and livestock feed additives, organic farming systems rely on crop rotation, animal and plant manures as fertilizers, some hand weeding and biological pest control.[2] Some conventional agriculture operations may include limited polyculture, or some form of Integrated Pest Management. (see Industrial organic agriculture). </dd> <br> <br>
