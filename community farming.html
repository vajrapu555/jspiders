    <dd>Using crop diversification and companion planting (allowing for increased pest control, building healthy soil, shade benefits, reducing available space for weeds, and more).
        Rotating crops (building healthy soil, reducing buildup of certain pest/disease populations, and replenishing soil nutrients).
        Planting cover crops (protecting soil and reducing erosion, and increasing organic matter and nutrient content of soil).
        Focusing on plant varieties that are suitable for our specific climate (using drought or low-water-tolerant plants adapted to local soil and climatic conditions to avoid fighting nature or putting more resources into growing healthy plants than necessary).
        Using native plant species where possible (especially pollinator-friendly plants like wildflowers to increase the presence of bees, birds, etc.).</dd><br><br>
